				<h2>Study description</h2>
				<p>
					Hello there!
					I am looking into developing a new version of Closed Captioning quality evaluation software. In order to enhance and reflect the viewer's subjective assessment of the software, I am conducting user research to understand the quality assessment process by viewers who are d/Deaf or Hard of Hearing.
					In this study, each participant will be asked to watch a set of captioned video clips, and then to rate the quality of the CC. The study involves completing a basic demographic information questionnaire, the rating session described above, and a short semi-structured interview regarding your experience with the study. The expected total time commitment for participation is 60 minutes. You will receive a small honorarium for participating in this study ($30 CAD).
					If you would like to participate in the study, <a href="https://forms.gle/hJrEidccX56msKNp7">please fill in this form</a>. ASL interpreters are available with notice free of charge.
					Your participation in the research will be of great importance to assist in changing the process of CC quality assessment for d/D/HoH individuals.
					Thank you for your time and participation.
					*There will be no in-person data collection. Instead, this study will be conducted virtually if you would like to participate in the study.
					Sincerely,
				</p>

				<h2>Instructions</h2>
				<p>In this study, subjective assessment on the quality of live Closed Captioning (CC) by Deaf or Hard of Hearing (D/HoH) viewers will be studied.<br>
					Purpose of this study is to	develop a method of assessment which reflects D/HoH viewer’s opinions.<br>
					Participants will be shown a series of video clips with live captions and report any errors, they identify.<br>
					Next, you will be asked to rate the confidence level of your error detection as your rating of quality.<br>
					There are four types of possible errors that you may see:
					<ol>						
						<li>Words omitted</li>
						<li>Paraphrased caption</li>
						<li>Delay* (being slower than 3 seconds)</li>
						<li>Presentation speed (being too slow or too fast)</li>
					</ol>
					*The 3 seconds delay you see at the beginning of clips would be to replicate the technical delay in the real setting of live Closed Captioning.<br><br>
					Please watch all videos until the end otherwise, the whole study will be invalid.<br>
					If you do not have the captions loaded in the first video, then you should close the survey and restart. <br>
					Please accept apologies if the captions were not loaded in the first time.
