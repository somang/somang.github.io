      <h1>2017, Educational game for kids</h1>
      <p>
        In 2017, a game design project was done to participate in the Canada Aviation and Space Museum for children's space nutrition education.
        The user-centred design approach was taken from the beginning of the project.

      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        SpaceJam is an educational game that was developed to spark children's interest in space travel and encourage them to learn more about the International Space Station. 
        SpaceJam presents the journey and potential obstacles faced by a spaceship taking off from Earth to the International Space Station, with a 
        particular focus on astronaut physical health and space flight nutrition. 
        The game was designed for a younger demographic, as the information content that is being taught is not highly complex and will likely only be new to children aged from 10 to 14 years old. 
        The goal was to incorporate game features that make the game both engaging and educational for the player. 
        Ultimately, the game should motivate the player to want to learn more about the subject.
        In this study, we compare the learning outcomes of playing SpaceJam and reading a text about the same subject. 
        The study is designed to answer the question of whether or not playing SpaceJam results in better learning outcomes than reading text media about astronauts’ health during space travel.
        This study compares the pre-test and post-test of two groups who learned the same information using different media. 
        Additionally, surveys and observations were collected during the study to evaluate the usability of the game and apply the required changes. 
        The goal of the study is to measure the effectiveness of SpaceJam as an educational tool.

        <p>
        The methodology used in SpaceJam’s user study workshop was specifically focused on determining whether individuals learn space nutrition knowledge better by playing the game SpaceJam rather than 
          using a conventional medium. This was done by using many research methods such as observations, data collection and interviews.
More specifically, observations in the user study workshop were made by analyzing and gathering information from the user’s behaviour. 
          This was done when users were playing SpaceJam as well as when users were reading the related text. 
          In addition, text data along with nominal and ordinal data were collected through pretest and posttest questionnaires. 
          The same methodology was applied in the Rondon et al. study where users completed questionnaires to figure out whether computer game-based learning is better than a traditional method of learning. 
          In addition to the above, all participants were asked one to two interview questions at the end following either the gameplay or the article.
Overall, the main methodology used in this study workshop was the correlational method as relationships between variables were our study’s main focus.
          The same kind of methodology was used in the Sadler et al (2015) study where variables were compared between users learning through a computer-based game and other narratives. 
          Finally, we can safely observe that there is a normal balance in our research between relevance and precision. 
          This was done by successfully collecting data through real-life game or article experience by conducting interviews and at the same time much of the data collected is fairly easy to control.
