        <h1>2024, Designing a user interface for caption quality evaluation tool</h1>
        <p>
          The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulates the quality of Closed Captioning (<a href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/info_sht/b321.htm">link</a>), which uses a specific model to assess. 
          The assessment requires certified evaluators to compare the televised captions with the transcript and generate a quality report for the broadcasters to audit the quality.
          In this project, a software tool was designed using the User Centre Design principles. 
          It iterated two cycles of user research, including the System Usability Scale (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_usability_scale">SUS</a>) and user studies with initial user interface design and an Alpha prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
          Total duration: <kbd>11 months</kbd>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a <mark>Product Manager</mark>, I designed the <kbd>user research</kbd>, <kbd>interviews</kbd>, <kbd>questionnaires</kbd>, led and directed the <kbd>interface design</kbd>.
          In addition, I communicated the change from the design cycles along with the developers for lean and agile development.

          <h2>1. Requirement gathering</h2>
          <p>
            From the initial stage, two objectives were focused on in order to develope a dedicated user interface.
            <ol>
                <li>Task requirements</li>
                <li>Need, Want, and Wish lists (Desired workflow)</li>
            </ol>
          Starting from the baseline knowledge, the fact that the <a href="https://nercanada.ca/">Canadian NER model</a> process was studied to learn the required tasks.
          Two domain experts were interviewed and generated a list of pain points from the current tools and processes.
          In addition, it was possible to acquire the existing tool that users were using. With these, initial requirements list was created.

          <h2>2. Prototyping with the baseline knowledge</h2>
          <p>
            Initially, the Canadian NER model quality assessment procedure was studied to see how error severity was determined and how each error types were defined.
            The requirement lists and benchmarking of some other existing tools for other purposes were taken as design references.        
            This allowed us to go through the initial low-fidelity prototype and potential user journey.

      <h3>High fidelity prototype</h3>
      <p>
          Due to time and resource limitations, the initial study was only done 6 months into the project.
          The project had to work with the software development team in parallel leaving no time to be wasted.
          Therefore, the sketches were evaluated by the team, and the initial proof of concept level of software was implemented to be tested with the expert users.
          Then, the first high-fidelity prototype was created.

          In order to communicate with the stakeholders, a user journey of the desired system was also presented.

      <h2>3. First user study</h2>
      <p>
          The first user study was planned to test the usability of the interface and system, as well as to learn deeper into the experts' workflow and desires.
          Therefore, the study was designed in the following order:
          <ol>
              <li>Demographic questionnaire</li>
              <li>System Usability Scale (SUS) on the current interface</li>
              <li>User tasks (think aloud protocol) with semi-structured interview questions</li>            
          </ol>
          User tasks were split into three high-level topics. 1) Sign up & sign in, 2) Create a project, and 3) Perform the evaluation using the system.
          At each page transition, participants were asked to describe their expected system behaviour, as well as what they would do with the presented interface.
          The qualitative data was collected using video and audio and then analyzed using <a href="https://condens.io/">Condens.io</a> for open coding.

        <h2>4. Design recommendations, second iteration of the user research, and after...</h2>
        <p>
          From the first round of user studies, a set of design recommendations was found from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_analysis">thematic analysis</a>.
          These design recommendations were then presented and discussed with the software development team, followed by an interface update on the tool.
          Upon implementation, a <mark>second round of user study was performed with the same five expert users.</mark>
          The second study was designed in the following order:
          <ol>
              <li>User tasks (think aloud protocol) with semi-structured interview questions</li>
              <li>System Usability Scale (SUS) on the NERWEB interface</li>            
          </ol>
          The final version specifically asked about the user experience in seeing AI-generated quality assessment to be used as a decision support tool in quality assessment.
          The user reaction towards the AI system was positive, which was also highlighted in their reaction to how it was presented at the end of their own evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SUS score comparison showed that there was improved usability from the conventional interface to the NERWEB interface, which was already proven by participants' reactions in the interview.
        A non-parametric statistical analysis for with-in group repeated measures (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman_test">The Friedman test</a>) was performed for comparing the two sets of SUS scores.
