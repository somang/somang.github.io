# Designing user interface for caption quality evaluation tool

The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulates the quality of Closed Captioning, which uses a specific model to assess. The assessment requires certified evaluators to compare the televised captions with the transcript, and generate a quality report for the broadcasters to audit the quality.

In this project, a software tool was designed using the User Centre Design principles. It iterated two cycles of user research, including the System Usability Scale (SUS) and user studies with initial user interface design and an Alpha prototype.

# Initial requirement gathering

From the initial cycle of interviews, three objectives were focused.
 1. Task requirements
 2. Current workflow
 3. Need, Want, and Wish lists

## Task requirements

Initially, the Canadian NER model quality assessment procedure was studied to see how error severity was determined and how each error types were defined. Then, semi-structured interview was designed to ask about current workflow and work settings.
